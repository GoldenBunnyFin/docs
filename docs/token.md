The Golden BUNNY (GBUNNY) token doesn’t have a max supply. For every 1 BNB earned in the
performance fees, 10 GBUNNY is minted, so supply is not capped at the
moment. We may establish new strategies to limit the cap or burn some
tokens, however currently we are focused on the growth of the GBUNNY
token. You can earn GBUNNY by using the farms, or you can buy GBUNNY
through our zap function. Roughly 13% of all GBUNNY mints will go towards
development to ensure rapid innovation.

- Honest $cake Farmers: Deposit CAKE-BNB LP and reap the benefits of
  the compounding effect. With Simple Interest, the APY is 150% for
  CAKE-BNB, however, if this gets compounded it becomes 347% APY. The
  assumptions are the following: 1) initial capital is $1m, 2)
  transaction cost: $1, 3)Compounded Once Daily. The transaction cost
  assumes it takes 4-5 steps for Pancake GBunny to compound deposits.
  Around 25% of GBunny’s profits will be bonuses. Some percent of the
  farming profits will be saved as BNB in the GBUNNY Reward Pool.

- Degens: Buy GBUNNY at the start of launch. Sell when the price
  becomes high enough to fulfill your greedy desire. The Probability
  of GBUNNY dropping below the initial price of $3 is very low. 1)
  Presale Participants bought GBUNNY at $3 and will not sell below
  that price at a loss. 2) As GBUNNY Price goes up, GBunny issued volume
  will decrease.

- Smart Investors: Stake GBUNNY long-term. The APY of GBUNNY Pool is
  amazing and real! The meaning of GBUNNY Pool’s APY 100% is if you buy
  $10 worth of GBUNNY now and stake it for 1 year, you will receive
  $10 worth of BNB. If you sell the remaining GBUNNY on the market,
  you can also capitalize on profits there. If you are a wise
  investor, you would meticulously analyze the APY of the staking pool
  and earn profits not only from the BNB rewards, but also from
  selling the GBUNNY as well.

- We are starting off with the following fee structure:

  1.  30% Performance fee

  2.  0.5% withdrawal fee if withdrawal happens within 72 hours of
      deposit

  For further clarification the 30% performance fee is collected and
  given to the GBUNNY stakers. For every 1 BNB earned through
  performance fees, 10 GBUNNY is minted and given to respective users.
  So long as the price of GBUNNY stays above 1BNB/10, users are
  actually earning money through this performance fee system. All of
  these fees will ultimately go towards staking GBUNNY, thereby
  ensuring the sustainability and longevity of our project and
  benefitting GBUNNY supporters/holders.
